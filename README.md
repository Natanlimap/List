# About the project
### Programming Project #1: Implementing the List Abstract Data Type
  This project was requested by a basic data structure teacher, Selan Rodrigues dos Santos, from UFRN, with the porpuse to implement a List Abstract Data Type based on a doubly linked list.

### Initially
1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https:://github.com/natanlimap/Vector.git
```

## Running the tests
1. Enter in the test path

2. On terminal, use this commands
```sh
g++ -std=c++11 driver_list.cpp
```
## The tests

This tests will show if the implementation of each method of list class is running as expected.
